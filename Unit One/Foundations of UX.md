# Foundations of UX Design

### UX History
    first came about in phrase during the 90's 
    Has roots in feng shui

### UX 
    - primary focus on how a user uses or interacts with products

##  Week 1

### Define UX 
    - how a person, the user, feels about interacting with a product
    - a product is a goof feature or service. 

        could be a physical product
        could be software
        could be delivery service. 

## What makes up a good UX

### Usability 
    how well does it work? think glass ketchup bottles UX v plastic bottle UX

### Equitable
    is the design useful and parektable to people with diverse abilities and backgrounds

### Enjoyable
    is there a positive connection that is made between the object or service rendered? 
    The whole idea of UX is to make this area as strong as possible. 
    Takes into account thoughts and feelings

How is this accomplished 
    
    Research - collecting evidence on how they are experiencing the product in real time. 
    Ask them about it.



### Useful
    Does it solve a problem? If so how well does it accomplish this? 
    Is the juice worth the squeeze of the design? 

## Jobs in the field of UX

### Interaction Designers
    focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They are to connect the
    user's needs  and the business goals with what's actuallyt feasible to build. In this space
    the user ALWAYS comes first

    An interaction designer's work answers questions like: What should happen if a user taps on
    this button? How do we make this action easier for users to complete? And, how are the 
    design elements within the website laid out? Interaction designers focus less on how the 
    product looks and instead strive to make the product easy to navigate and simple for users to interact with.



### Visual Designers
    Visual designers focus on how the product or technology looks. They can do logos, illustrationsa, 
    or icons, they can choose font size, color, size, etc or work on a product layout.

    The role of a visual designer is to answer questions like: What kind of visual style should
    icons have, in order to fit the product's branding? Or, which color and font should we use
    for this button? The goal of a visual designer is to delight users with designs that inspire,
    engage, and excite them.

### Motion Designers
    Motion designers think about what it feels line for a user to go through the motion or move 
    through a product or how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or website

    A motion designer’s work answers questions like: How should an app transition between pages?
    How do we show the connection between these actions? And, what’s an engaging animation that 
    will help tell our story? Motion designers focus on design elements that move, rather than
    traditional static designs.

### VR/ AR Designers
    Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) designers create products that provide users
    with immersive experiences, unbounded by the limits of the physical world. Virtual reality in
    volves a wearable headset that takes over a user’s vision; it blocks out their physical
    surroundings and immerses them in a completely virtual world. For example, VR can feel like 
    you're entering the setting of a magical imaginary land. 

    On the other hand, augmented reality uses the physical world as a backdrop and adds virtual 
    elements on top of it. Users are still contextually aware of their surroundings, but their 
    reality is augmented, or enhanced, by adding elements through a screen. For example, you 
    can sit in your actual kitchen, and an AR experience can add digital images, like a new 
    barstool or a piece of artwork, to the room around you.

    A VR or AR designer’s work answers questions like: How do we create a user experience that 
    leverages 3D space? Or, will this action cause a user motion sickness? To ensure users are 
    comfortable immersing in a VR or AR experience, designers need to carefully consider 
    everything from sound to lighting.

## Common colleagues 

- UX Researchers:  conduct studies or interviews that help us learn how people use a product
- UX Writers: think about how to make the language within a product clearer for the purpose of
creating a more intuitive experience. They will design such things as writing labels for buttons or 
  adjusting a tone between formal and friendly
  
- Production Designers: they are typically a bridge between interaction designers and engineers.
they make sure first and final designs match the finished product materials and that the assets are 
  ready to be handed off to the engineering team. Assets include everything from text and images 
  to the design specs like font,size, color, spacings etc
  
- UX Engineers: UX designers work most frequently with. They translate the design's intent into a functioning 
experience like a website or app

- UX Program Managers: ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building moves 
smoothly from start to finish. 
  
- Conversation Designers: Conversation designers make it possible for users to have natural conversations to get things done. They leverage user research, psychology, technical knowledge, and linguistics to create user experiences that are intuitive and engaging. Conversation designers develop the “persona” or personality of the voice, as well as the flow and dialog of the interaction.
Conversation designers answer questions like: What’s the ideal language and flow based on who users are, the task to be accomplished, and the context of the conversation? Does the personality of the virtual assistant seem genuine, engaging, and reflective of the brand values? How does the conversation work with on-screen elements? Does the virtual assistant offer a consistent, usable, and useful experience end-to-end? 

# Product Development Life Cycle

    Process used to take a product or idea to a reality

## Stages

### Brainstorm : active discovery stage that is about idea generation about the user and potential needs or challenges the user might have.
    he brainstorm stage is also an ideal time to check out your product's competitors and identify if there are already 
    similar products available in the market. You want your product to fill a gap in the market 
    or solve a problem better than existing products. Completing research into both your 
    competitors and your users helps determine what problems need to be addressed by the product’s design.

### Define : takes the brainstorm and defines it into product. who it's for, what it will do, what features that it needs to be successful. Statements that outline the goals or outline the problems you want to answer withing the product design are the focus of define stage. 
    During the define stage, your team narrows the focus of your idea. One product can’t solve every user problem. 
    Continuing with the example for an app to help working parents and guardians, your idea should
    focus on helping parents and guardians find reliable childcare or manage their schedules, not
    both. In this stage, a UX designer might help the team pin down the focus of the idea, but a 
    product lead will probably be the one to define the scope of the project. 

    The research you completed in the brainstorm stage comes in handy now. Using what you've 
    learned, you will pinpoint your potential users’ problems. Your team can’t assume they know 
    what problems users are experiencing without asking the users directly.

### Design : actively develop ideas. They check that the specs from define stage are realistic. 
    designers keep user top-of-mind. They design assests, storyboards which help explore the user's experience, 
    wireframes that outline the layout or prototypes which are models that allow ux designers to test the 
    functionality of a design. 

### Test : testing stage evaluates the product design based on feedback from potential users. testing focuses on the user first design second. It helps find ways to refine or improve the design


### Launch : Spread your product to the world and share


## What makes a design good or poor???
    Don't reflect a user's needs

# Job responsibilities of entry-level UX designers
- Researching
- Wireframing
- Prototyping
- Creating Information Architecture
- Communicating Effectively

### Research - to understand audiences and learn about backgrounds, demographics, motivations, pain points, emotions, and life goals

### Wireframes - outline or sketch of a product or screen either by sketch or digitally

### Prototyping - early model of a product that demos functionality

### Creating Information Architecture - framework of a website or how it's organized, categorized, and structured. 

### Communicating Effectively


## Specialists, generalists, & the tales of T-shaped designers
    
### Generalist - designer with a broad number of responsibility ie: coding, prototyping, visual design, ux research, writing
    in a small company, however. these roles could be as multiplicitous as 
        - user research
        - branding
        - user flows
        - ux writing
        - visual design
        - prototyping
        - production design
        - information architecture
        - usability testing
        - etc.

### Specialist delves into on particular design role like interaction, visual, motion design

While a generalist has a wide breadth of knowledge, a specialist has a deeper understanding in particular areas
this leads to the idea of a T-shaped designer
